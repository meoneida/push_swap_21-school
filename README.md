School 21 project 100 ev points. 
This is easy and 100% working realization push_swap - the project of school 21, read push_swap.pdf.
It makes any numbers of int, given as argv parameters, sorted. No duplicated!
Please, make.
Examples:

Output will be the commands like ra, rb, rra, rrb, rrr, sa etc.
Checker_linux tests the output like:
